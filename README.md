mr: microrheology toolkit
=========================

All of the particle-tracking code in `mr` has been merged
into the [trackpy](https://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy) project, which is still
actively maintained by myself and others. I recommend any users
of `mr` switch to `trackpy`.

The code for loading image sequences and video has been split off into
a separate project called [PIMS](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims)
(Python Image Sequence). PIMS is used by trackpy, but it has more general
utility as well.

Background
----------

This package was developed and is maintained by Daniel Allan, as part of his
PhD thesis work on microrheology in Robert L. Leheny's group at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, MD. The work was supported by the National 
Science Foundation under grant number CBET-1033985.
